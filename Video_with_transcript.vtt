Oh! So how was your trip to the UK? I haven't even seen you since you got back. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000 
Busy a lot of meetings and work, but I love it over there. You know the DJH contract we've been trying to win?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000 
Yes, of course.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000 
So, I played golf with the official who is supposed to make the decision on whether we get the contract or not.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000 
Wait — I didn't know you're a golfer! 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yeah!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000 
So, how did it go?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000 
Good. It was funny because he forgot his wallet and I had to pay for both rounds.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000 
So, who won?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000 
Well I'm a pretty good golfer. I played on my college team. We were ranked No. 1 in the division. But … I let him win. He was completely thrilled.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
Nice Ace! (thumping fist) I'm sure it would've been easy for you to crush the old bloke. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Of course!
